# sCRO Security Overview

## Architecture Overview
sCRO implements a multi-layered security architecture designed for institutional-grade operations.

## Smart Contract Security

### Verification Status
- ✅ **All Contracts Verified**: Full source code available on BSCScan
- ✅ **Proxy Architecture**: Upgradeable contracts with timelock
- ✅ **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions for all critical functions

### Key Security Features
1. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**
   - Every mint operation validated by zk-SNARKs
   - Cryptographic proof of locked collateral
   - Generated off-chain for efficiency

2. **Multi-Oracle Validation**
   - Chainlink: Primary price and state oracle
   - Band Protocol: Secondary validation
   - Witnet: Tertiary consensus layer
   - No single point of oracle failure

3. **Multi-Signature Wallet**
   - 3-of-5 signature requirement for critical operations
   - Time-delayed execution for major changes
   - Transparent on-chain governance

## Bridge Security

### Private L2 Architecture
- CRO tokens stored on private Cronos fork
- Isolated from public chain vulnerabilities
- Complete control over validation rules

### Cross-Chain Security
- Event monitoring on source chain
- Proof generation and validation
- Atomic operations prevent partial transfers

## Operational Security

### Monitoring
- 24/7 automated monitoring systems
- Anomaly detection for unusual patterns
- Automatic pause mechanisms for emergencies

### Risk Management
- Daily reconciliation of locked vs minted tokens
- Maximum daily minting limits
- Rate limiting for large transfers

## Audit Trail
- All operations logged on-chain
- Transparent proof-of-reserves
- Regular third-party audits planned

## Emergency Procedures
1. **Pause Mechanism**: Instant freeze of minting/burning
2. **Recovery Process**: Multi-sig controlled recovery
3. **Communication**: Direct channels to all integrated platforms

## Best Practices for Integrators
- Always verify contract addresses from official sources
- Implement proper decimal handling (8 decimals)
- Monitor official channels for updates
- Use multi-sig for platform holdings
